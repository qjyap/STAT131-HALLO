# STAT131-HALLO
This was the final project for Stats 131 in Fall 2019, Python and Other Technologies for Data Analysis. We conducted data cleaning, exploratoy analysis and data modeling on Kickstarter data up to date as of January 2018. This was my first real experience working with large datasets using data science tools from Python such as pandas, sklearn and statsmodels and I really enjoyed working on this project!

The data can also be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects#ks-projects-201801.csv 
All credits to Kaggle user kemical (Mickaël Mouillé) for scraping the dataset.
